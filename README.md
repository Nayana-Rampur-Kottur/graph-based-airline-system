## Project Overview

This project simulates the **airway management system** for "Indian Airways", focusing on finding the **shortest route** between two cities based on direct flights available.  
The system leverages **graphs** (using adjacency matrices) and **Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm** for calculating shortest paths between airports.

---

## Objective

To build a system where:
- Each city is treated as a **node**.
- Each flight path is an **edge** with a weight (distance).
- Users can:
  - View available cities and flights.
  - Find the **shortest flight route** between two cities.

---

## Graph Concept

A **graph** is a collection of **vertices (cities)** and **edges (flight paths)** where each edge can have an associated weight (distance or cost).

**In this system:**
- Cities are nodes.
- Flight distances are weights.
- **Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm** is used to compute the minimum distance between two nodes.

---

## System Design

- A **weighted directed graph** is represented using an **adjacency matrix**.
- Each element `matrix[i][j]` indicates the distance from city `i` to city `j`.

## Structures and Data Representation

| Structure | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| `Graph` | Contains adjacency matrix and city names. |
| `Priority Queue` | (Internally used in Dijkstra) - for efficiently picking the next nearest city. |

---

## Operations and Logic

| Operation | Logic |
|:----------|:------|
| **Add City** | Adds a new city to the system. |
| **Add Flight Path** | Adds a direct flight between two cities with given distance. |
| **Display Available Cities** | Lists all cities added. |
| **Find Shortest Route** | Runs Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm to find and print the shortest path and total distance between two selected cities. |

---

## User Interaction Flow

1. **View Available Cities**
   - Lists all the cities (nodes) currently in the system.

2. **Add Flight (Optional)**
   - Admins can add new direct flights between two cities by specifying distance.

3. **Find Shortest Route**
   - Enter source and destination cities.
   - System computes the shortest route using Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm.

4. **Exit**
   - End the session.
